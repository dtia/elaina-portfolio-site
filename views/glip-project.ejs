				Users of RingCentralâ€™s product have typically used its calling, texting, and fax capabilities primarily for reaching external clients. These users do communicate internally with other employees, but typically did not use RingCentral products to achieve this goal. Recognizing the gap in internal collaboration features, RingCentral acquired Glip, a real-time messaging and team collaboration app (similar to Slack), aiming to become a fully-integrated communication platform.
