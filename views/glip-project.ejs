			<p>
				Users of RingCentralâ€™s product have typically used its calling, texting, and fax capabilities primarily for reaching external clients. These users do communicate internally with other employees, but typically did not use RingCentral products to achieve this goal. Recognizing the gap in internal collaboration features, RingCentral acquired Glip, a real-time messaging and team collaboration app (similar to Slack), aiming to become a fully-integrated communication platform.

				The first step in integrating the acquired product was to rebuild their non-performant javascript mobile app in native code. In order to quickly release a functional, reliable app, the app functionality and design remained similar to the existing app, with a reskin to RingCentral brand guidelines, and an addition of some usability enhancements that would improve the experience and feel native on iOS and Android.

			<h3>My Role</h3>
			<p>
				While the original objective of this project was to re-brand Glip and optimize the app for native mobile platforms, I helped the team realize that we could also use this as an opportunity to re-structure some of the key flows for a better user experience.
